# Simple-Bungeecord-List

This project is nothing, but a simple bungeecord /glist command rewritten just to look a little better.

You can use this plugin if you want for your server, but do not expect regular updates. This is just a /glist command.

Requires:
- 1.8 Java version for your server
- Any version of BungeeCord (I don't know if it runs on any bungeecord fork, for example Velocity, or FlameCord)

You can download the .jar file in the Release section.


Permissions:
- in.glist - The /glist command
